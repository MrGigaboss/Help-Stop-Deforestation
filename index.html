    <h2>What Is Deforestation and Why Does It Happen?</h2>
    <p>
      Deforestation is when trees either get cut down or destroyed. Now why? you
      ask well the main reason why all the trees are becoming... dead is because
      of one stupid problem the need of houses, yep totally stupid right? Kinda
      you know about agriculture and all of that right? Well put this in your
      brain why are people DESTROYING houses to MAKE more houses?! One of the
      big 3 reasons why Deforestation is a big problem is because, they are
      actually destroying Native American houses, and not only that but animal
      houses too, and all for what, more homes? Alright fine I agree agriculture
      is no the only reason why Deforestation is happening, they are also
      destroying trees for the gas or oil inside them. This really doesnt make
      sense there is something calles ELECTRICITY that can also start fires.
      Like bro we just found out how to make
      <a href="https://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion">Fusion</a>
      possible (Fusion is how the sun makes energy) and no we just need to keep
      cutting down trees (with the power of the sun on earth that means that we
      would not have to pay for our electriciy bills anymore.)

<h2>How Does This Effect Us?</h2>  
<p>
well There are many thing but here are a list of the top few that are extremely VITAL
<ul>
<li>Oxygen, trees produce oxygen through <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/photosynthesis/">Photosynthesis</a> </li>
(We cut around 41 million trees a day and 15 billion a year. Only 1 billion trees are planted
each year which means that we would last only 4,783 more years until all of the oxeygen on earth is gone)
<li>Without trees Global warming accelerates, as well as climate change, also 
because, of photosynthesis (Trees take in CO2 and let out O2)
</li>
<li>Not only does this affect human but all of the animals in the world.</li>

<li>Where:Brazil, and Indonesia (Mostly tropical areas)</li>
<li>When:8000 BC</li>
<li>How:Started because, of the use of fire</li>

</h2>
<p>
Yes we are finally at the end of why deforestation is not only a stupid problem
but a big one. So in the end I hope you have learned something and got inspired and stuff
I'm not forcing you to do all better and stuff but try to help. Thank you.âœ¨ðŸŽ‰ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ²
